Java Beginner Codes

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs I’ve written while learning the fundamentals of the language. It includes simple examples, exercises, and mini-projects covering key concepts such as:
	•	Variables and Data Types
	•	Conditional Statements (if, switch)
	•	Loops (for, while, do-while)
	•	Functions and Recursion
	•	Arrays and Strings
	•	Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, etc.)

This repo is perfect for beginners looking to understand Java through hands-on code. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
